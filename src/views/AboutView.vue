      <p>I'm a Master's student specializing in Human-Computer Interaction Design.
        I also love Machine Learning, and I'd like to explore the intersection
        of AI and Interaction Technology in the future.
        I am half a year away from graduating from my Master's,
        and I am currently looking for a company to do my Graduation Assignment with.
        Are you or someone you know interested?</p>
